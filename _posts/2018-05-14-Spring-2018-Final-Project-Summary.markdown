<br/>
### [*__A.R. Horse__*][p1]
#### **Team: Samarth Goyal, Peter Ginty, Ben Patient**
*To design an augmented reality app to play the basketball game H-O-R-S-E. Make a successful flick-to-shoot physics based game. We want to be able to play our app whenever we want, wherever we want.*

<br/>

---
<br/>
### [*__Synthtouch__*][p2]
#### **Team: Sasha Kurkcuoglu, Kenneth Chan**
*SythTouch is a user­interface for sound modulation on the android device. We will be developing an application that uses certain hardware features of the device to create sound as an output. This application uses the accelerometer and the touch features to allow users to play with sound. This app will be very user friendly and will allow for people to have fun with sound.*

<br/>

<br/>
### [*__AR Snake Game__*][p3]
#### **Team: Yini Wang, Boning Dong**
*Our goal is to transform the classic snake game in to an augmented reality form. We want to create an augmented reality where the user can play the snake game though the camera as if the game world is on a paper or table.*

<br/>

---
<br/>
### [*__GeoChat__*][p4]
#### **Team: Gustavo Cornejo, Subhodeep Choudhury**
*GeoChat is a cloud-based community media sharing platform where users can view and upload videos and images based on their geographic location. In essence, GeoChat is an android application that allows local communities to share pictures and videos with each other. The application features an element of exclusivity as it only allows people who are geographically inside of the community to view and upload images to that particular feed. In addition, each post that is made has an expiration date that is set to 24hrs after it was posted. The inspiration for this app came from the strong sense of community that many of us feel in Isla Vista. We saw that many applications lead us to over sharing content with irrelevant people and often miss sharing with those who really matter, the people near us.*

<br/>
### [*__ColorMind__*][p5]
#### **Team: David Donaldson, Timothy Kwong**
*Colormind will be a mobile game app where players are challenged with a puzzle in order to decode a sequence of colors. The game will be implemented with Java for an Android platform.*

<br/>

---
<br/>
### [*__Munchies__*][p6]
#### **Team: Eirik Sandberg**
*Making an application which can make suggestions on restaurants based on user specified preferences. These preferences will be things like what type of cuisine and what radius the restaurant should be within. The restaurants will be found using Google places API and will be listed in a user interface. Preferably, the user interface would be looking somewhat like Tinder, where the user will get the nearest suggestion first and then either choose to accept that or get a new suggestion. This could be achieved with various libraries. When the user accepts a suggestion from the app, directions to the place should be provided using Google Maps.*

<br/>

<br/>
### [*__PlayGround__*][p7]
#### **Team: Chutian Shen, Nicole Moghaddas**
*The application will incorporate a social network aspect, including many common features seen in social network messaging apps seen today. Users will be able to view and maintain a Friends List, with the ability to Add Friends. There will a profile for each user, which might display game statistics, such as scores and rankings in different games. There would also be a Chat feature, core to the social design, so that users can message each other, such as in chat rooms.*

<br/>

<br/>
### [*__ThrowTopia__*][p8]
#### **Team: Jesus Diera, Connor Northend**
*ThrowTopia is a groundbreaking new game coming soon to the Android platform. We will be making use of the Unity SDK and other APIs to create the game. The physics of the game will be created with Unity and the rest of the App will be done using Android focused API’s so that we don’t end up using Unity for the whole game. We could make use of API’s for users high scores, retaining customization features, obstacles, and level selections.*

<br/>

---
<br/>
### [*__IR Hub__*][p9]
#### **Team: Jeremiah Prousalis, Jesus Castro**

*We are making an Android application that will be used to complement our Capstone Project. This Android application will allow the user store and maintain all of their remote controls lying around their house. The application will act as a truly universal remote control. We will be integrating Android’s Bluetooth Low Energy capabilities for this app to be able to connect to the IR Hub.*

<br/>

<br/>
### [*__NextSlide__*][p10]
#### **Team: Yang Ren, Brian Canty**

*NextSlide is an app that aims to provide a smarter presentation. By harnessing voice recognition, NextSlide will allow users to control their display without using their hands. It will be as if you have a partner built into the presentation who handles all the work.*

<br/>

---
<br/>
### [*__PlanR__*][p11]
#### **Team: Alan Tran, Timothy Hinh**

*PlanR will be easy-to-use for casual users, but will also have more detailed options and settings for other users. The plan for how the app will work is to use text and text identification in pictures to determine useful information for scheduling. It will also use the APIs for social media and messaging applications on the phone to recognize the user’s intent to attend events and then schedule them if desired by the user.*

<br/>

<br/>
### [*__Brew View: The Beer Die Tracker__*][p12]
#### **Team: Nathan Vandervoort, Kyle Kellenberger**

*For the final project of ECE 150 our project will be an android application called Brew View. It will be a general tracking application for the popular drinking game Beer Die. Beer Die has various trackable statistics such as throws, catches, and points, as well as a player base that we believe would enjoy the application and use it to make the game both more fun and more competitive. Every game traditionally starts with the first player to throw the die to yell “Die up!” Our hope is that with our application “die up” will never die down.*

<br/>

---
<br/>
### [*__PhonePotato__*][p13]
#### **Team: Alex Nagase, Mark Wu**

*PhonePotato is a game that involves throwing and spinning a phone to collect points. The higher the phone is thrown and the more times it is spun in mid air, the more points will be awarded.*

<br/>

---
<br/>
### [*__Android Game: Tank__*][p14]
#### **Team: Jianyang Lu, Weiyi Zhou, Yi Yan**

*Our goal is to make a tank moving and shooting game that utilizes various APIs and sensors. Based on traditional computer tank games that fight with enemies, we are going to introduce new features such as voice control to the game. Players can interact with the game through various built-in sensors. Also, the game can be controlled with a conventional touch screen as well. In addition, multiplayer mode will be available through internet.*

<br/>

<br/>
### [*__Escavive__*][p15]
#### **Team: Yan Kong, Yingchun Du**

*Obtaining inspiration from Outlast II, a new released horror game, and Pokémon Go, a popular Augmented Reality game, we decide to create our own AR horror game – Escavive, which combines both elements from horror and AR games. This name comes from two words: escape and survive. Our initial idea is to utilize camera feed as the game scene and add some camera filters to render the atmosphere of terror. And ghosts will appear randomly and head toward the player. The player needs to run and escape to survive. Also, to increase playability, we use and set some special image targets around, which allows the player to pick up game props such as camcorders batteries (to kill the ghosts) and med kits (to heal) to fight back.*

<br/>

<br/>
### [*__FeedMe__*][p16]
#### **Team: Shaman Bhat, Varun Nagaraj**

*The main motivation for creating this application is to provide convenient means of nutritional knowledge to the user. We know that health and time are of paramount importance, especially for students and hence we conceptualized this application to cater to their needs. Our aim is to create an application which presents users with instant food recipes and nutrition facts based on the ingredients available.*

<br/>

<br/>
### [*__Smart Meditate__*][p17]
#### **Team: Bradley Hall, Bradly Odell**

*Our goal of this project is to create a new, innovative app that helps users meditate. The app, Smart Meditate, is different from other meditation apps currently in app stores. Instead of using voice guided meditation, Smart Meditate uses binaural beats, heartbeat sensing, and guided breathing to create a new meditation experience. This app will have two activities. One being the main screen, where the guided breathing orb will grow and shrink. There will also be icons displaying the user’s heart rate and the frequency of binaural beat playing. The second activity will show stats of the user’s meditation, like duration and average heart rate. The phone’s camera and flash will be used to read the user’s heart rate. In order to create sounds this app will use the Android AudioTrack class. It will also use various Android SDK classes for the animated graphics.*

<br/>
### [*__Appricot__*][p18]
#### **Team: Miclos Lobins, Clara Frausto**

*This application is an image editor that allows one to combine multiple images together. We want to create multiple preset templates for users to pick from. Users can then choose to add photos into the template one chose. Images can be resized and rotated, and filters can be applied. There will be an option to draw on the images as well.*

<br/>

<br/>
### [*__Bop Dat!__*][p19]
#### **Team: Nate Diamond, Zach Meyer**

*Create revolutionary smart-phone application inspired by the household kids’ game Bop-It! Change the paradigm of mobile accelerometer based games. Not violate any intellectual property laws. Create an artistically simple, aesthetically pleasing app.*

<br/>

---
<br/>
### [*__Voice Memo__*][p20]
#### **Team: Eddie Rojas, Qian Li**

*Our goal is to make a voice recorder which can record voice and save it in the phone. Then user can display it after clicking the saved voice. Next, the memo will classify each piece of voice according to their type. For example, if the voice is from a human, it can be classified as speech; if the voice sounds like a piece of music, it can be classified as music. Finally, the recorder can detect the starting point of the voice. If the blank lasts for 3 seconds, the recorder will stop record and “nothing is recorded” will be shown. It will detect if it is a blank according to the frequency.*

*Our project for this ECE 150 will be Voice Memo. Our app, Voice Memo will be an app with similar capabilities of the built in recorder but it will have the addition of eliminating white noise at the beginning of a recording and the option of sending the audio and parse audio into text.*

<br/>

<br/>
### [*__ColorMe__*][p22]
#### **Team: Trevor Morris, Kellie Toyofuku, Bernardo Celis Garcia**

*We strive to create an android application called ColorMe. This application allows the user to have endless creativity to customize their memories.*

<br/>

---
<br/>
### [*__SongBird__*][p24]
#### **Team: Dylan Vanmali, Patrick Vidican**

*Songbird will allow easy switching between music sources via Bluetooth. One user will be the music source at any given time, and this user will be able to play their music across all other devices in the piconet. When someone wants to change a song, they will make a request to become the music source, and all other devices in the piconet will begin playing the new user’s music.*

<br/>

---
<br/>
### [*__SONOS COM__*][p25]
#### **Team: Brenden Fujishige, Marcellis Carr-Barfield**

*Build a high quality intercom device that seamlessly integrates with your existing Sonos devices. Connect the COM to the home wi-fi network. Be able to use and discover the COM on a wi-fi network to communicate with the app. Implement basic music playback functionality such as play/pause, forward/back, etc by interfacing with the COM device.*
